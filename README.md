This is a SIMD implementation of a double precision complex number type. Its API is designed to (almost entirely) mirror that of the C++ standard library double precision complex type.

If you would like to see the API expanded, you may of course fork it. Please open a pull request, in that case. If you are uncomfortable with SIMD intrinsics, but you would still like a particular addition to the API, the original developer will consider requests to expand it himself. (I'll probably do it, if you ask nicely.)
